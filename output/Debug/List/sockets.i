*
* Note(s) : (1) For systems that don't need any high, real-time priority interrupts; the tick interrupt
*               should be configured as the highest priority interrupt but won't adversely affect system
*               operations.
*
*           (2) For systems that need one or more high, real-time interrupts; these should be configured
*               higher than the tick interrupt which MAY delay execution of the tick interrupt.
*
*               (a) If the higher priority interrupts do NOT continually consume CPU cycles but only
*                   occasionally delay tick interrupts, then the real-time interrupts can successfully
*                   handle their intermittent/periodic events with the system not losing tick interrupts
*                   but only increasing the jitter.
*
*               (b) If the higher priority interrupts consume enough CPU cycles to continually delay the
*                   tick interrupt, then the CPU/system is most likely over-burdened & can't be expected
*                   to handle all its interrupts/tasks. The system time reference gets compromised as a
*                   result of losing tick interrupts.

*             NOT IMPLEMENTED
*
* Method #2:  Disable/Enable interrupts by preserving the state of interrupts.  In other words, if
*             interrupts were disabled before entering the critical section, they will be disabled when
*             leaving the critical section.
*             NOT IMPLEMENTED
*
* Method #3:  Disable/Enable interrupts by preserving the state of interrupts.  Generally speaking you
*             would store the state of the interrupt disable flag in the local variable 'cpu_sr' and then
*             disable interrupts.  'cpu_sr' is allocated in all of uC/OS-II's functions that need to
*             disable interrupts.  You would restore the interrupt disable state by copying back 'cpu_sr'
*             into the CPU's status register.

/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and

 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings is choosen by defining any
 * number of _LOCALE_USE_xxx and _ENCODING_USE_xxx symbols. The application
 * will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is always
 * supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. One preselected locale and one preselected encoding is then used
 * directly. That locale can not be changed during runtime. The preselected
 * locale and encoding is choosen by defining at most one of _LOCALE_USE_xxx
 * and at most one of _ENCODING_USE_xxx. The default is to use the "C" locale
 * and the single byte encoding, respectively.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"
 * locale and the single byte encoding.

 *                                default pointer and back.
 *   _DLIB_TLS_REQUIRE_INIT       Set to 1 to require __cstart_init_tls

 ****************************************************************************
 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 * If locks are to be used (_DLIB_MULTI_THREAD != 0), the following options
 * has to be used in ilink: 
 *   --redirect __iar_Locksyslock=__iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlocksyslock=__iar_Unlocksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockfilelock=__iar_Lockfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockfilelock=__iar_Unlockfilelock_mtx
 *   --keep     __iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 * and, if C++ is used, also:
 *   --redirect __iar_Initdynamicfilelock=__iar_Initdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Dstdynamicfilelock=__iar_Dstdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Lockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 * Xlink uses similar options (-e and -g). The following lock interface must
 * also be implemented: 
 *   typedef void *__iar_Rmtx;                   // Lock info object
 *
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a system lock
 * The interface handles locks for the heap, the locale, the file system
 * structure, the initialization of statics in functions, etc. 
 *
 * The following lock interface is optional to be implemented:
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a file lock
 * The interface handles locks for each file stream.
 * 
 * These three once-initialization symbols must also be defined, if the 
 * default initialization later on in this file doesn't work (done in 
 * DLib_product.h):
 *
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_MACRO(control_variable, init_function)
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE_INIT
 *
 * If an external TLS interface is used, the following must
 * be defined:
 *   typedef int __iar_Tlskey_t;
 *   typedef void (*__iar_Tlsdtor_t)(void *);
 *   int __iar_Tlsalloc(__iar_Tlskey_t *, __iar_Tlsdtor_t); 
 *                                                    // Allocate a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsfree(__iar_Tlskey_t);               // Free a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsset(__iar_Tlskey_t, void *);        // Set a TLS element
 *   void *__iar_Tlsget(__iar_Tlskey_t);              // Get a TLS element
